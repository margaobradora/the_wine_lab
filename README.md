# The Wine Lab

## Overview

Welcome to The Wine Lab, a personal project focused on web scraping to gather details about the best-selling Spanish wines during the Christmas season of 2023. This project utilizes various technologies and tools, including Selenium, Beautiful Soup, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), SQL, and Tableau. The goal is to extract meaningful information from a wine website, transform it into a structured format, and then analyze and visualize the data for insights using SQL and Tableau.

## Project Phases

### 1. Web Scraping with Selenium and Beautiful Soup

In this phase, we employ Selenium for web automation and Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing. The combination of these tools allows us to navigate through the wine website, locate relevant information, and extract details about the best-selling Spanish wines during the Christmas season of 2023.

### 2. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

Once the data is scraped, the ETL phase begins. The extracted information may not be in a structured format suitable for analysis. Therefore, we transform the raw data into a structured and organized format. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and structuring it in a way that facilitates easy analysis.

### 3. SQL Database Integration

The transformed data is then loaded into an SQL database for efficient storage and retrieval. SQL queries can be used to further analyze the data, perform aggregations, and answer specific questions about the best-selling Spanish wines during the Christmas season of 2023.

### 4. Tableau Visualization

To gain meaningful insights and present the findings in a visually appealing way, Tableau is utilized for data visualization. Various charts, graphs, and dashboards are created to showcase patterns, trends, and key information about the top-selling Spanish wines. This step adds a layer of interactivity and provides a user-friendly interface to explore the data.


## Conclusion

The Wine Lab project offers a comprehensive approach to exploring and analyzing the details of the best-selling Spanish wines during the Christmas season of 2023. Feel free to adapt and extend the project based on your specific requirements or explore additional features to enhance the analysis.

Cheers to discovering the world of Spanish wines! üç∑üìä
